            <p>THE VALUATION PROCESS:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part1">
            <img src="ex5.png" alt="Exhibit 5">
            <p>The first step in completing the DCF, was to compute the sales for each of the</p>
            <p>company's individual showrooms from 2013-2019 (the given forecast period). Since 
            </p>
            <p>this valuation takes place in 2012, we need to forecast the values for the sales 
            </p>
            <p>for these years. I applied decreasing growth rate values, that were determined by 
            </p> 
            <p>looking at historical growth rates, to each year. After forecasting the sales, I 
            </p>
            <p> finished the income statement by applying different rates and ratios I determined 
            </p>
            <p>from looking at historical data, to each of the other five line items.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="part2">
            <img src="ex6.png" alt="Exhibit 6">
            <p>For the balance sheet for each individual showroom, a similar process as the one</p>
            <p>above was implemented. Using historical data, I determined what percentage of each
            </p>
            <p>year's sales should be taken to determine the accounts recievables. For each line
            </p> 
            <p>below it, the same process was applied using the different ratios of the different
            </p>
            <p>line items shown. The capital expenditures were dependant on future purchase plans.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="part3">
            <img src="is.png" alt="Income Statement">
            <p>This is the pro forma income statement, taking into account all of the company's</p>
            <p>showrooms. I summed up all of the values from all showrooms for each of the line
            </p>
            <p>items presented in the Exhibit 5, to get to the final net income for each year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part4">
            <img src="bs.png" alt="Balance Sheet">
            <p>These are the same steps as the ones described above but for the pro forma balance
            </p>
            <p>sheet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part5">
            <img src="teuer.png" alt="Cash Flow Analysis">
            <p>This is the final step in the DCF analysis. Putting together both the income</p>
            <p>statement and the balance sheet to create the cash flow statement, resulting in</p>
            <p>the forecasted cash flows for each year. The sum of these cash flows can then be</p>
            <p>discounted to the present value using the given discount rate, and summed to the
            </p> 
            <p>present value of the terminal value. This gives us the asset value of the firm.</p>
            <p>To then get the value of a singular share of the firm, we divide the asset value</p>
            <p>by the number of shares outstanding. The price per share is 32.25.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part6">
            <img src="characteristics.png" alt="Characteristics">
            <p>The first step in completing the public comparables valuation is to find comparable</p>
            <p>companies to the one you are trying to value. Given a list of furniture stores, I
            </p>
            <p>calculated six quantitative and three qualitative characteristics about each of</p>
            <p>the different furniture stores.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="part7">
            <img src="comps.png" alt="Public Comparables">
            <p>I used the quantitative characteristics from the table above to calculate three</p>
            <p>different multiples for each of the different furniture stores. I compared these</p>
            <p>multiples and the qualitative characteristics from the table above with the</p>
            <p>multiples and qualitative characteristics of Teuer, to decide which companies were
            </p>
            <p>most comparable to Teuer. I ended up choosing ETH, HVT, LZB and, TPX as the most</p>
            <p>comparable. I calculated what the share price would be using each of the three</p>
            <p>multiples averaged between the chosen companies. The three share prices were 24.80,</p>
            <p>27.79, and 15.45. All three resulting share prices are lower than the 32.25 we got
            </p>
            <p>from the DCF. Although this is slightly discouraging as the public comparables is
            </p>
            <p>supposed to serve as a supplement to the DCF, the DCF is always to be trusted more
            </p>
            <p>as it is a more intrinsic valuation approach.
