            <p>My name is Constanza Estrada Navarro. I am currently a Junior from New York City at</p> 
            <p>Northwestern University, studying Economics and Computer Science with a Kellogg</p> <p>Certificate in Financial Economics. My Freshman Summer, I interned at Maestro by</p><p>Accordion, a fin-tech firm that sells a subscription based software to private</p> <p>equity companies to help them organize and create value for their portfolio</p>
            <p>companies. After getting to work on both the software and finance side of Maestro,
            </p>
            <p>I became very interested in value creation and getting to learn about growth</p>
            <p>strategies and how they are executed in order to help businesses grow. Therefore,
            </p>
            <p>after this internship I began learning more about other areas of finance and I</p>
            <p>became interested in private equity and investment banking. This past Summer, I</p>
            <p>interned at Tuatara Capital, L.P., a small private equity firm; and next Summer I
            </p>
            <p>will be interning at Evercore as an M&A Summer analyst. I look forward to the steep</p> 
            <p>learning curve that comes with interning in investment banking, and growing my</p>
            <p>network.</p>

        <div class="dance">
            <p>Aside from finance, I have a few other passions, the main one being dance. I</p> 
            <p>trained in classical ballet at American Ballet Theatre’s (ABT) training program</p> <p>from age 5 till being a Sophomore in high school. I then auditioned for and</p> 
            <p>attended LaGuardia, a performing arts high school, as a dance major. My freshman</p><p>year I was training for a total of 6 hours every day at LaGuardia in the mornings,
            </p>
            <p>and ABT in the evenings. Although I was very grateful to get to train with such a
            </p>
            <p>prestigious company, where I also got the chance to perform at the Metropolitan</p>
            <p>Opera House and Lincoln Center, training six hours a day was not only physically</p><p>painful, but it took away a lot of time from other passions I was starting to</p> 
            <p>develop in STEM. Therefore, my sophomore year I decided to leave ABT, and I enjoyed</p> 
            <p>my last three years of high school training slightly less intensely at LaGuardia. I</p> 
            <p>currently no longer desire to pursue ballet professionally as I once did, however I</p>
            <p>still love to dance as a hobby. Due to a lack of ballet groups at Northwestern, I
            </p> 
            <p>co-founded Eight Counts Ballet Company as the director of finance, where I teach</p><p>and take ballet classes weekly. This way, I can continue to enjoy a passion of mine</p> 
            <p>at the club level. </p>

        <div class="travel">
            <p>Another activity that I love is traveling. I was born in England, raised in New</p> <p>York, and my entire family is from Mexico. I think because of my multiple</p> 
            <p>identities, I have developed the desire to see the whole world. I’ve traveled to</p>
            <p>every continent except for Antarctica, but some of my favorite countries I’ve been
            </p> 
            <p>to have been Brazil, Spain, France, and Italy. My all time favorite country to</p> 
            <p>travel to however, is definitely Mexico. Aside from the fact that I like to visit
            </p>
            <p>family, I love going to Mexico because it has my favorite culture, food, music,</p>
            <p>types of people, and architecture. There are so many beautiful cities in Mexico that
            </p>
            <p>I have yet to visit, and I hope to see them all one day.</p>

        <div class="repartiendo">
            <p>Speaking of Mexico, another one of my interests is a non-profit called Repartiendo
            </p>
            <p>el 24. In 2004, my aunt founded Repartiendo el 24, based in Monterrey Mexico, in</p>
            <p>order to help the kids who work on the streets of Monterrey. Throughout the year</p>
            <p>we work to collect donations and sponsorships to be able to buy food, toys, and</p>
            <p>blankets, rent a bus, and drive around the city on December 24th to distribute</p>
            <p>these items, and give the kids the Christmas that they deserve but unfortunately</p>
            <p>do not recieve. As of a few years ago, I have begun to take a greater role in the
            </p>
            <p>organization; I now am in charge of finances and social media.</p>

            <p>A few final things that I love are music, sunrises, iced coffee, the ocean, and</p> <p>spending time with friends and family.</p>
